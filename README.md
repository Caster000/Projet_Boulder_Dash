Here is the repository of the group composed of Amine Ghoumid, Adrien Vandenbossche, Thomas Rivollet et Baptiste Chevallier.

The goal of this project is to reproduce a game named " Boulder Dash " ( NES version ) in Java language.

We first did some of the design with game tests and UML diagrams.

We then programmed our different parts and put them together thanks to Git.
